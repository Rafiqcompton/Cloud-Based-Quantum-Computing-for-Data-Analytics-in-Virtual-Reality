Transpile the Quantum Circuit: Transpile the quantum circuit, which includes the QFT algorithm, to a specific quantum hardware. This step ensures that the circuit is optimized for execution on the chosen quantum device.
Quantum MapReduce: Implement a quantum version of MapReduce to process the large dataset. This involves dividing the data into smaller chunks and applying quantum algorithms to perform the map and reduce operations in parallel. The quantum parallelism allows for faster processing of the data compared to classical MapReduce.
Data Visualization in Virtual Reality: Once the quantum computations are complete, visualize the results in a virtual reality environment. Use A-Frame or a similar framework to create interactive 3D visualizations of the processed data. This can include 3D scatter plots, bar charts, or other visual representations that provide insights into the analyzed data.
